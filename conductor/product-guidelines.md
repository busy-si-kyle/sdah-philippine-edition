# Product Guidelines - SDA Hymnal Philippine Edition

## Tone of Voice
- **Clear and Helpful:** The website's copy should be direct and easy to understand. It should prioritize assisting users quickly, especially when they are using the site during church services or in time-sensitive situations.

## Accessibility & Presentation
- **Presentation Mode:** To support worship services, the website should feature a simplified, distraction-free "Presentation Mode." This view should be optimized for projecting lyrics onto screens, removing navigation elements and focusing solely on the hymn text.

## Layout & User Interface
- **Hymn Page Priority:** 
    - **Lyrics First:** Individual hymn pages should prioritize clear, large-font lyrics as the central content.
    - **Action-Oriented Header:** Prominent, easy-to-find buttons for "View Sheet Music," "Present," and "How to Contribute" should be placed at the top of the hymn page to facilitate immediate action. The contribution link should lead to clear, standardized MuseScore transcription guidelines.
    - **Simplified Search Results:** To maintain modern minimalism and clarity, search results should only display the hymn number and title, omitting lyrics snippets.
    - **Seamless Sequential Navigation:** Users should be able to move between hymns easily using floating navigation arrows (desktop), keyboard shortcuts (Left/Right arrow keys), or mobile swipe gestures for a continuous discovery experience.
    - **Integrated Support:** Pages should include an accessible "About" modal for context and a "Report an Issue" form to maintain data accuracy through community feedback.
    - **Security First:** Maintain a low-risk profile by avoiding dangerous React patterns (e.g., `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`), sanitizing all user inputs, and performing regular dependency audits.
- **Modern Minimalism:** Adhere to the visual identity of high contrast and sans-serif typography to ensure maximum readability across various devices and lighting conditions.
